In this concept, we’d like to add an additional response to the bot. If the bot is asked “how are you” – we’d like the bot to send the text activity back “I’m great!”

### Task
1. In the bot’s solution, find the EchoBot class
2. Add the following reply text “I’m great!” to the message activity if the message contains “how are you”

### Goal

The goal of this exercise is to show you can navigate a C# solution, and comprehend enough C# to make the necessary changes to the class.

### Submission
Preferably, you could clone these projects, make the needed change to the necessary file, then push to a new GitHub repository with your answer. If that’s not possible, you may submit the file with necessary changes to jcrockett@arlingtonva.us
